## What is LiskIn?

LiskIn is a decentralized application (dApp) on the Lisk L2 Blockchain that allows for a decentralized digital identity for individuals and institutions.

**Verifiable LinkedIn on the Lisk Blockchain**

LiskIn uses the power of blockchain technology to tokenize educational and professional credentials. This allows for institutions to issue qualifications and certifications such as University degrees to usersâ€™ wallets hence making the credentials of the individual verifiable forever.

## Why does it exist?

Some facts:

- Emerging Markets suffer from a lack of transparency and credential integrity which slows growth and deters foreign investment.

- 140 job applications are submitted through LinkedIn every second.

- Average cost of a background check is $40.

LiskIn brings credential integrity to Emerging Markets at a low cost by severly lowering the cost of background checks and the Lisk L2 can handle a high number of transactions per second (as compared to the Ethereum chain), allowing it to compete even with the likes of LinkedIn.

## How we built it

LiskIn is built with a React front-end and a Solidity Smart Contract on the Lisk Blockchain called LiskIn.sol.

## Challenges we ran into

Lisk being a new L2 blockchain had limited support and documentation so it was a nice learning challenge to develop on it. Overall, the documentation was quite helpful along with the faucet, bridge and low gas fees made it a pleasant experience.

## What's next for LiskIn

LiskIn can become much bigger. It has the possibility to turn into a DeSoc platform with plenty of incentives for both users who want verifiable credentials and institutions who want cheap verifiable background checks.
